         It was just a cold February night.  One which held little entertainment or impact towards the future other than that it was Valentine’s Day, but that was simply a holiday (of sorts) and in the grand scheme of life, proved little in the way of leading an everyday existence.  It wasn’t our first engagement on this seemingly most romantic of days, the relationship had bloomed through that first romantic day and even more so throughout the other 364 days of the year, almost making a single day, a brief moment seem almost innocuous.  But don’t think that that day is unimportant or believe that we did not truly enjoy our cupid inspired spell.  And perhaps it was more effervescent than the usual work filled days, but it was really like most other days; there are always good days and bad days, this was a good day.</p>

         <p>
          Although past days and moments in time are important and can impact a great deal, it tends to be the stream, the overarching combination that truly matters and supports the creation of two lives into one.  It’s the little things.  It’s life that cements a relationship, not moments, right?...Right, well partially.  The forceful ever-moving rages of time weather you, if you survive its impact, it can even shape you.  The long term and the months are what truly build you and provide the basis for the relationship.  But, perhaps the instances can also truly matter.  And is it possible that the moments are important, perhaps they are most important.  And if you will, even the lengths of time can be construed as only vast amounts of singular moments linked seamlessly together to create the larger picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps it's the linkage of these moments stretched across time that create our life and relationships.  And some moments are more important than others.  Oh yes, the little things matter.  The note on the bathroom mirror, a single rose at dinner for no apparent reason other than to say, "I love you", and the simple acts of making the bed and washing the dishes are all important.  These simple seemingly insignificant acts are positive displays of feelings and are the glue that holds everything together. But again, some moments are bigger.  All this has been said to introduce you to one of those flashes in time that tie everything together, an affirmation to the aforementioned displayed musings if you will.

          But I digress, back to the beginning.   It was a cold February evening and while Erin was beginning the trek home after work.  While the plans for a fully-fledged three-course meal had been made days in advance, I (per usual) decided to begin directly before her arrival having waited till the end to begin.  I chose Valentine’s Day for a very specific reason, not because it would be more romantic (perhaps that would have been much too cliché), but because it allowed for surprise.  What better a night that this to build a romantic dinner that allowed no glimpse or notion of what was to come.  This was expected, or at the very least, understandable.  What I got was what I wanted, a positive reaction, but not an overreaction.

          As Erin entered the door, she was greeted by the aroma of the dinner well underway.  I briefly deserted my post to welcome her in, but was quickly called back by the sounds of items dangerously nearing the over cooking stage. I excused myself, retreated to the kitchen, and began finishing my work. When the meal was all but finished, I offered a bottle of wine (one which we both enjoy) and began putting the finishing touches on the food.

          Although the setting was somewhat informal and it came after a busy day of work, it was still magical. The dinner itself consisted of delicately seasoned Italian sausage and feta cheese stuffed potatoes, paired with grilled chicken breasts seasoned with herbs.  For the side, I used an olive oil and lime zest infused asparagus spears with a light coating of salt and pepper.  As these parts were combined, we sat down to dinner to eat.  I placed a vase of roses between us and we enjoyed a nice meal filled with great conversation.  As the dinner came to an end, it was time for desert.  I had prepared a dark chocolate ganache fondue inspired with a nice cognac, which was paired with freshly sliced fruit.  As we neared the end of our meal, I picked up my plate and prayed Erin followed suit.  As she picked up her dish, a note underneath caught her eye.  She picked it up and read what was written inside, she looked at me with tears of happiness and said yes.

          Was it all a bit cheesy?  Was it all a bit staged?  Sure.  But it was all worth it, absolutely.  The surprise was complete and the mood was joyous.  In the end, we both knew that we had made the right decision and that this was the start to something wonderful.  &copy; 2014 Alex Wells.
