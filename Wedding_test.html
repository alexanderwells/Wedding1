        <p>
          It was a chance meeting, a meeting, which spawned from a mutual workplace, one that we both had taken post graduate school in efforts to begin our careers.  It was not the dream job, nor was it where either of us wanted to be, but that chance encounter has made all the difference in our lives and wouldn’t change it for the world.

          I had been working at Fort Knox for about a month when I met a handsome, new co-worker, Alexander Wells.  We got to know each other over the next few months by talking and joking around at work.  Not only was Alex handsome, but I quickly realized that he is also intelligent, warm, and funny.  I was interested in Alex early on, but I thought that he was already dating someone and assumed that we would just be friends.  We started texting outside of work, especially when I travelled to Washington DC and Colorado. After I returned to Louisville after Thanksgiving vacation, Alex asked me out to dinner.  Having been somewhat thick headed when it came to a guy’s interest in me, I still was not completely sure it was a date.  We met at Boombozz Pizza, then got coffee and walked down Bardstown Road.  I had a great time browsing at the unique shops and getting to know Alex.  We talked for hours and as Alex walked me to my car, I did not want the night to end.  Thankfully, Alex felt the same and was quick to ask me on a second date.  Since then, that spark has grown into a deep friendship and loving relationship.  I am so grateful to be marrying Alex and cannot wait to be his wife!  &copy; 2014 Erin Richardson.
